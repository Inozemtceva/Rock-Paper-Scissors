## History of the Game 
According to the WRPSA - World Rock Paper Scissor Assosiation! 
"The earliest form of Rock Paper Scissors was created in Japan and is called Janken.  This is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. Janken uses the Rock, Paper and Scissors signs. It is the game that the modern version of Rock Paper Scissors derives from directly. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th Century. This was between the Edo and Meiji periods."
